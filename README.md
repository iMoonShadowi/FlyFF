# FlyFF

Hello, Thanks for tagging along! NB This is not a playable test enviourment at this time. I am mainly focusing on structuring and layout. For now it is just some basic inputs and more will come.




Todo:
Database -> 0% Everything missing.
Networking -> 0% Everything missing.
UI -> 0% Everything missing. Might do some inputs here next week for Inventory so i can continue on character work.
Enemies/NPCs -> 1%, structure is written but not pushed yet.
Character -> 30% 
-> Todo Character wise:
Implement pickup, attack, Stats etc towards the character.






Finished:



Positions i will require people for later:
UI Work
Map Work
Model work
